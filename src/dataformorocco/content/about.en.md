### *Data for Morocco, our new initiative for moroccan Open Data*

This project aims to bridge the gap between citizens/companies and Moroccan open data by providing user-friendly data. Our goal is to empower individuals, researchers, and businesses with the tools and resources they need to harness the power of open data.

The data we will provide will be :
- **reconciled**: no need to process and merge multiple files to get the variation of a measure over years ; each dataset will have data for all years available.
- **formated** : tabular format (`.csv`).
- **transparent** : all transformations will be traceable with data lineage (thanks to [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)).
- **described**: data will come with descriptions and metadata to easily understand the context.
- **open-source** : All the code related to data extraction and transformation will be available.

You are welcome to contact and tell us what (open) data you would like to find.
