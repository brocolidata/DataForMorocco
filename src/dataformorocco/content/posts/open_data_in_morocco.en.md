- **formated** : tabular format (.csv).
- transparent : all transformations will be traceable with data lineage (thanks to dbt).
- **described** : data will come with descriptions and metadata to easily understand the context.
- **open-source** : All the code related to data extraction and transformation will be available.

You are welcome to contact and tell us what (open) data you would like to find.
